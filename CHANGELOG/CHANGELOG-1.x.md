## [1.7.0] - 2024-OCT-30

### Added
### Changed
- **DEBT:** Optimized Struct Alignment for Reduced Memory Usage: 
  - Reordered fields in the `Config` struct from largest to smallest to minimize padding.
  - Changed data types of `AlphabetLen` and `Step` from `int` to `uint16`, reducing the `Config` struct size from 56 bytes to 32 bytes. 
  - Ensured that the `generator` struct fields are aligned efficiently, reducing its size from 72 bytes to 56 bytes.
- **DEBT:** Integrated IsPowerOfTwo Optimization in Generate Function:
  - Added an `IsPowerOfTwo` field to the `Config` struct to indicate if the alphabet length is a power of two. 
  - During initialization, calculated whether the alphabet length is a power of two. 
  - In the `Generate` function, included logic to skip the boundary check if `int(rnd) < g.config.AlphabetLen` when the alphabet length is a power of two, improving execution speed without increasing allocations.

## [1.6.0] - 2024-OCT-29

### Added
- **FEATURE:** Added [Nano ID collision calculator](../docs/nanoid-collision-calculator.html).
### Changed
- **DEBT:** Check for duplicate characters using a bitmask with multiple `uint32`s. A `uint32` array can represent `256` bits (`32` bits per `uint32 Ã— 8 = 256`). This allows us to track each possible byte value without the limitations of a single uint64

## [1.5.0] - 2024-OCT-28

### Added
- **FEATURE**: Added Code of Conduct
- **FEATURE**: Added Contribution Guidelines
### Changed
- **DEBT:** Optimized overall implementation to reduce the allocations per operation to 2.

## [1.4.0] - 2024-OCT-26

### Added
- **FEATURE:**: Added concurrent benchmark tests.
### Changed
- **DEBT:** Maintained Safety with Linter Suppression: Added `// nolint:gosec` with justification for safe conversions.
- **DEBT:** Refactored Slice Initialization: Initialized `idRunes` with zero length and pre-allocated capacity, using append to build the slice.
- **DEBT:** Ensured Comprehensive Testing: Reviewed and updated tests to handle all edge cases and ensure no runtime errors.
### Deprecated
### Removed
- **FEATURE:** Removed Unicode support for custom dictionaries.
### Fixed
- **DEFECT:** Fixed Operator Precedence: Changed `bits.Len(uint(alphabetLen - 1))` to `bits.Len(uint(alphabetLen) - 1)` to ensure safe conversion.
