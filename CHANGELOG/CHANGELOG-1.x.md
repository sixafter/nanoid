## [1.30.0] - 2025-06-13

### Added
### Changed
- **debt**: Modified tests to reflect the new `Config()` method in the `Interface` interface.

### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
### Security
- **risk:** Seed zeroing: ChaCha20 key and nonce material are immediately cleared from memory after cipher creation, preventing any residual secret data.
- **risk:** Fail-fast initialization: The pool uses a capped-retry loop and panics on repeated failures, guaranteeing that no insecure or uninitialized PRNG state is ever used.
- **risk:** Automatic key rotation: Keys rotate after a configurable byte threshold (default 1 GiB), bounding keystream lifetime and eliminating reuse vulnerabilities.
- **risk:** Jittered back-off: Retry delays for key rotation employ exponential back-off combined with cryptographically sourced jitter, avoiding synchronized retry storms under low-entropy conditions.
- **risk:** In-memory cipher wipe: After a successful rotation, the previous ChaCha20 instance is overwritten with its zero value, eradicating any leftover key schedule or counter state.
- **risk:** Concurrency safety: Each goroutine checks out its own prng from a sync.Pool, ensuring exclusive access to the ChaCha20 cipher and preventing internal state corruption.

    - `makeASCIIBasedAlphabet(length int) string`: Generates a printable ASCII alphabet of the specified length, starting from `'!'` (33) to `'~'` (126).
    - `makeUnicodeAlphabet(length int) string`: Generates a Unicode alphabet of the specified length, using a range of Unicode characters (e.g., from `'अ'` to `'ह'`).

### Changed
- **DEBT:** Optimized Struct Alignment for Reduced Memory Usage: 
  - Reordered fields in the `Config` struct from largest to smallest to minimize padding.
  - Changed data types of `AlphabetLen` and `Step` from `int` to `uint16`, reducing the `Config` struct size from 56 bytes to 32 bytes. 
  - Ensured that the `generator` struct fields are aligned efficiently, reducing its size from 72 bytes to 56 bytes.
- **DEBT:** Integrated IsPowerOfTwo Optimization in Generate Function:
  - Added an `IsPowerOfTwo` field to the `Config` struct to indicate if the alphabet length is a power of two. 
  - During initialization, calculated whether the alphabet length is a power of two. 
  - In the `Generate` function, included logic to skip the boundary check if `int(rnd) < g.config.AlphabetLen` when the alphabet length is a power of two, improving execution speed without increasing allocations.
